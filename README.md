# Netflix Movies Data Analysis
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix movies dataset to uncover meaningful insights about content trends available on the platform. The dataset includes information such as movie titles, release years, genres, duration, ratings, and countries.

Using Python, the data was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies. Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy were used for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Various analytical techniques were applied to understand patterns in movie releases over the years, popular genres, distribution of content by country, and duration trends.

To make insights easy to understand, data visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including bar charts, line plots, and distribution graphs. These visualizations helped identify trends such as growth in Netflix content, genre popularity, and changes in movie durations over time.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and analytical thinking. It also highlights the ability to work with real-world datasets and extract actionable insights, making it relevant for Data Analyst and Data Science internship roles.
